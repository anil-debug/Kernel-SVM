# Kernel-SVM

Implementation of the Gaussian RBF Kernel in Support Vector Machine that classifies data non-linearly.

An object of the SVC class is created. The SVC class is imported using the sklearn.svm library.

A confusion matrix is created to check the number of accurate and inaccurate prediction the model made.
